It was created a simple CRUD app which contains all elements included in main task.

Additionally: 
I used serializers and models to data validation.
I used ,,generics" from DRF to implement Views/Endpoints.
I covered models and endpoints with basics tests

All the plugins that I used are in requirements.txt file.
